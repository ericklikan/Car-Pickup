Decription:
Car follows a straight black line with two sensors in order to steer through the line.
The car stops when both sensors touch a black line and using a servo motor, an attached lever picks up the ball,
turns around, and follows the same initial line and goes back again. At the end of the line, the lever drops the ball into a 
basket.
